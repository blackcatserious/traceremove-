## Cat Animation

This repository includes a small HTML/CSS demo that animates a stylized black cat.
Open `cat_animation.html` in any modern web browser to view the animation.

If you are in a Python environment, you can also run the helper script:

```bash
python view_cat_animation.py
```

The script simply opens the HTML file in your default browser.
